Bash scripting is great for small and efficient scripts designed mainly for repeating instructions1. However, it becomes cumbersome when tasks require more complex steps1. It’s not suitable for large-scale software development due to its lack of support for data structures, object-oriented programming, and other features found in more robust programming languages2.
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules or protocols that enables software applications to communicate with each other to exchange data, features, and functionality34.
A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is an API that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services34.
Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs56. These services are owned by small, self-contained teams and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently5.
The CSV (Comma Separated Values) format is a plain text file that stores data by delimiting data entries with commas78. Each new line in the CSV file represents a new database row and each database row consists of one or more fields separated by a comma8.
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and arrays (or other serializable values)910.
In Python, package and module names should be short, all-lowercase names1112. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability1112.
Class names in Python should normally use the CapWords convention1113.
Variable names in Python should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability1114.
Function names in Python should also be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability1114.
Constant names in Python are usually declared in UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES1115.
The significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python is that it’s used for naming classes1113. This convention helps distinguish class names from other types of identifiers in the code.
